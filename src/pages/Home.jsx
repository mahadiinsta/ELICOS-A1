          ELICOS A is the first StudyVillage module for English language
          students. You should now should feel confident you have a
          well-resourced friend in your corner, available for advice and someone
          to talk to. The first survey section contains questions on the topics
          ‘Safety’, ‘Study Habits’, ‘Home Life’, ‘People and friendships’, and
          ‘Mental and physical health’. You’re asked to give yourself a score
          between 1 and 10 - indicating how you feel about each question within
          each of these sections. This first survey also asks you to set some
          goals around English language studies.
